### Overview:
This project is a game website made by and for ETSU students. It
is a place to put games created by ETSU students. 

### Project Structure: 
To understand the project structure, familiarize yourself with the
MVC (Model View Controller) structure. When clicking on a game, 
a value will be passed to the controller, which will decide which 
game to load. This is divided between the MVC folders in the main
BucStop folder.

			link together and pass information between them.
